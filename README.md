# PistarModelFactory 


 Pistar is an open-source goal modelling tool. Its key distinguishing characteristics are:
  - it runs entirely on the browser, thus no installation needed
  - high visual fidelity (we want your diagrams to be pretty, even when printed)
  - supports the [iStar 2.0 standard](https://sites.google.com/site/istarlanguage/)


Pistar Model Factory uses the Pistar modeling tool and combines objective modeling with software product line techniques.

## Enviromment Configuration File

The environment configuration file is a json file that has fundamental attributes to ensure that different functionalities can be activated from the model generated by Pistar.

The configuration file structure is constructed by the following attributes: environment, buttons and properties.

       {
          "enviromment": String,
          "buttons": Array<Buttons.class>
          "properties": Array<Properties.class>
       }

         "type": InputFileTypeEnum.class,
         "extension": InputFileExtensionEnum.class,
         "requestAttributeLabel": String,
         "label": String

### Sending Request Object

The [Service] object represents an abstraction of the HTTP request that will be responsible for making the connection with an external application.

#### Adding goal oriented model in request

To add the goal-oriented model in the body of the request, it is necessary to add the name "PistarModel" to the body of the attribute
[request], located inside the [Service] object, as in the example below:

     "request": {
         "content": "PistarModel"
     }

The request will have in its body an attribute with the name of content that will have the oriented model generated by PiStar as its value.

#### Adding inputs in request

In order for the request body to be mounted, it is necessary to pay attention to the definition of this object.In each object [Service]
there is a list of inputs that will be rendered on screen and are responsible for injecting the data received by the user in the request.
The [requestAttributeLabel] attribute of the [Input] object performs a binding with the [request] attribute within the object service. so that this link
The object is required that the value entered in the [requestAttributeLabel] is also defined as a key in the value of the [request] attribute.

Example:


    "request": {
        "modelFile": "PistarModel",
        "hddlFile": "hddlFile",
        "configFile": "configFile",
        "worldFile": "worldFile"            
    },
    "inputs":[
        {
            "type":"FILE",
            "requestAttributeLabel": "hddlFile",
            "label": "HDDL File",
            "extension": "hddl"
        },
        {
            "type":"FILE",
            "requestAttributeLabel": "configFile",
            "label": "Configuration File",
            "extension": "json"
        },
        {
            "type":"FILE",
            "requestAttributeLabel": "worldFile",
            "label": "World Knowledge File",
            "extension": "xml"
        }
    ]

In the example above, the modelFile, worldFile and configFile keys are linked to the inputs by the attribute [requestAttributeLabel].

### Enviromment

The attribute environment defines the name of the environment that will be loaded.

### Buttons
 
      {
         "id": String,
         "label":  String,
         "service": Service.class
      }


The attribute buttons represent the buttons on the menu that will trigger some service

### Properties

    {
         "name": String,
         "value": String,
         "placeholder": String,
         "checked": Boolean,
         "hide":Boolean,
         "type": TypesAttributesEnum.class,
         "elementType": ElementTypeEnum.class,
         "childrens": Array<Properties>
    }
 
 
The attribute properties represent the properties displayed in the elements. 
 - name : The name of property
 - value : The value of property
 - placeholder : The name displayed in input 
 - checked : The boolean that represent the selected input
 - hide : The boolean that show or hide the property
 - type: The property type
 - elementType: The type of element selected
 - childrens: The childrens of property
